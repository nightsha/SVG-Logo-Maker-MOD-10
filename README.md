# SVG-Logo-Maker-MOD-10
A logo generator using SVG
# Examples Folder
// This folder contains example SVG files created with the app.

<!-- 
It seems like you have a project directory structure for an Object-oriented programming challenge that involves creating an SVG Logo maker. While the provided structure is quite detailed, here are some additional details you might consider including in your project:

License File (LICENSE): If you plan to open-source your project, consider including a license file to specify how others can use and distribute your code.

Documentation (e.g., docs/): You might want to create a folder for additional documentation, such as usage instructions, API documentation, or design decisions. This can be helpful for both yourself and others who work on or with your project.

Configuration Files (e.g., .editorconfig): If you're using specific coding styles or editor configurations, you can include configuration files for tools like EditorConfig, ESLint, or Prettier to maintain code consistency.

Dependencies (e.g., package-lock.json or yarn.lock): When you're using Node.js and npm or Yarn, it's common to have lock files that specify the exact versions of your project's dependencies.

Testing Framework Setup (e.g., jest.config.js): If you're using a testing framework like Jest, you might have a configuration file (e.g., jest.config.js) to specify testing options.

Environment Variables (e.g., .env): If your project relies on environment variables for configuration, you may include a sample .env file or document the required variables.

Build Scripts (e.g., build.js): If your project requires a build process (e.g., transpilation, minification), you may include build scripts or configuration files.

Version Control System (e.g., .git/): While you have a .gitignore file, the .git folder itself represents that your project is under version control. Make sure to initialize a Git repository if you haven't already.

Continuous Integration (CI) Configuration (e.g., .travis.yml): If you're using a CI service like Travis CI, you might include a configuration file that specifies how your project should be tested and deployed.

Project-specific Folders (e.g., assets/ or public/): If your project involves additional assets like images, styles, or public files, you may create folders to organize them.

These details can provide a more comprehensive and organized structure for your project, making it easier to work on and collaborate with others. The specific files and folders you add may depend on the project's complexity and your development workflow. -->


<!-- The folder you're seeing, lib/, is typically used to store code files related to classes or functions. It's a common convention in programming projects to create a lib (short for "library") directory to organize your code.

Here's what you might expect to find inside a lib/ folder:

Class Definitions: This folder often contains JavaScript or other programming language files that define classes. In your specific project, you mentioned shapes.js, which likely contains class definitions for shapes such as Triangle, Circle, and Square. These classes would have methods and properties that define the behavior and characteristics of these shapes.

Function Definitions: In addition to classes, the lib/ folder might contain files with function definitions. These functions can be used throughout your project to perform specific tasks or calculations.

Utility Code: It's common to put utility functions and helper functions in the lib/ folder. These functions are used to perform common tasks that are needed across different parts of your project.

Test Files: As you mentioned, there's a shapes.test.js file in your lib/ folder. This is where you'd typically write tests for the classes or functions defined in your project. Testing is important to ensure that your code works as expected and to catch any bugs or regressions.

The lib/ folder, with its classes, functions, and tests, is a fundamental part of many software projects. It helps organize your codebase, making it easier to manage and maintain as your project grows. -->
